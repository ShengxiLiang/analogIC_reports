# Analog IC Report Samples

This repository contains a collection of selected report samples related to Analog Integrated Circuits (IC).
## Directory Structure

### `2022_courses`
This folder includes my Analog IC lab reports from my exchange at UC Berkeley.

- `Shengxi-Lab1`: Features hand calculations and analysis.
- `Shengxi-Lab2`: Contains MATLAB code and demonstrations of simulation iterations.
- `Shengxi-Final`: Showcases the process of multi-criteria tradeoff.

### `2023_courses`
This folder includes some of my course projects at UESTC.

- `Cascode Amplifier-Shengxi`: Demonstrates simulation, layout design, and post-simulation results.
- `IC Comprehensive Experiment-Shengxi`: This is a larger file that consolidates several classroom experiments. It explores various issues and findings in IC design and experimentation.

## About the Repository

These reports reflect my journey and learning in the field of Analog ICs.

## Usage

This repository has been created primarily to assist with my graduate study applications. It serves as a convenient reference for schools to review parts of my academic work in Analog ICs.

If you have any questions, need access to the complete project files and reports, or require further information, please feel free to [contact me](mailto:lllsx2002@gmail.com). I am open to providing additional materials or discussing the contents of my work in more detail.
